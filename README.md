# stdgfx
The Standard C Graphics Library (in an alternate universe!)

This is an under-development graphics library for the C programming language
that aims to make development and prototyping on C/C++ easy as pie! C has always
lacked a proper graphics interface, and although things like SDL, and OpenGL exist
they always have a large learning curve attached to them which makes beginners run
away. Recently, basic audio support for playing vorbis OGG files has been added as well!<br>

Along with this, most C courses do not approach into graphics because, you know,
C is supposed to be boring! All you may do is printf to the terminal and nothing else! <br>

This sucks, because C is really fun to program in! After all, going below C means writing
assembler. C is as close as you can get to the machine while still being portable. <br>

The current implementation of stdgfx uses SDL to implement most routines. This is under heavy
development, expect large changes soon! <br>

A nicely formatted PDF file as documentation is underway! Have fun! <br>
